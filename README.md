## What is EkScript? 

**EkScript compiles to many different languages with an easy to use but powerful compiler helping you write code that won't lose your trust in real battlegrounds \(i.e. production\)**

EkScript is easy-to-learn as it is almost 99% TypeScript syntax but more easier to use! It will save you from the perils of runtime-errors as well as compile-time errors. EkScript uses the JavaScript standard library. Being one of the most popular language, EkScript is the best choice for your next big project!

### Why EkScript?

EkScript was built out of the need for a programming language that meets the following requirements for an alternative language that...

1. **...is based on another very, very popular language developers use at present.** TypeScript's popularity and similarity with EkScript means developers won't have to relearn everything from scratch.
2. **...has static typing for avoiding runtime errors:** EkScript has a strong typing system making it perfect for minimizing trivial development bugs.
3. **...has a AOT and JIT mode without any VM:** Having a Just-in-Time mode means better developer productivity and faster iterations helping any organization or individual release software in record time. Combine that with a fully compatible Ahead-Of-Time mode means the final output will have state-of-the-art optimized performance. 
4. **...least amount of Runtime errors and more compile time errors:** The strong static typing baked in helps fix the most trivial bugs before they get to the end users of any software.
5. **...has no Pointers.** EkScript is a perfect combination of ease-of-use and high performance. Developers won't have to worry about pointers as it has an automatic garbage collection.
6. **...has the standard libraries similar to JavaScript:** TypeScript's choice for the base language means that EkScript supports all NodeJS and Browser APIs out-of-the-box. This means developers are jumping into familiar grounds and use their favorite standard library features.
7. **...compiles to many different Object-Oriented languages**: EkScript's ability to compile/transpile to JavaScript, C++, Dart, Kotlin and Swift gives it the ability to run on every possible platform present today ranging from the web to small-embedded devices. Its a real **learn-once-write-once-run-anywhere** programming language.

And many more things. Give it a go. You will love it.
