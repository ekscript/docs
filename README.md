## What is EkScript? 

**EkScript compiles to C and JS primarily with an easy to use but powerful compiler helping you write code that won't lose your trust in real battlegrounds \(i.e. production\)**

EkScript is easy-to-learn as it is almost 95% TypeScript syntax but more easier to use! It will save you from the perils of runtime-errors as well as compile-time errors. EkScript uses the JavaScript standard library. Being one of the most popular language, EkScript is the best choice for your next big project!

.It compiles to C which could result in a low-memory, low-space consuming binary. Not just that, it will give you a first-class C ABI.

### Why EkScript?

EkScript was built out of the need for a programming language that meets the following requirements for an alternative language that...

1. **...is based on another very, very popular language developers use at present.** TypeScript's popularity and similarity with EkScript means developers won't have to relearn everything from scratch.
2. **...has static typing for avoiding runtime errors:** EkScript has a strong typing system making it perfect for minimizing trivial development bugs.
3. **...has no Pointers.** EkScript is a perfect combination of ease-of-use and high performance. Developers won't have to worry about pointers as it has an automatic garbage collection.
4. **...has the standard libraries similar to JavaScript:** TypeScript's choice for the base language means that EkScript supports all NodeJS and Browser APIs out-of-the-box. This means developers are jumping into familiar grounds and use their favorite standard library features.
5. **...compiles to 2 most popular programming languages**: EkScript's ability to compile/transpile to JavaScript, C and Dart gives it the ability to run on every possible platform present today ranging from the web to small-embedded devices. Its a real **learn-once-write-once-run-anywhere** programming language.

And many more things.

## What's inside?

The final EkScript compiler will be written in Zig making it fast.

### **EkScript** ❤️ **TypeScript**

All TypeScript modules are 100% compatible with EkScript through an easy-to-use interop. So, no more wasting time relearning new languages.

### **EkScript Bundler**

EkScript comes with a modern bundler that takes care of all the difficult configurations for you.
