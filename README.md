# EkScript

## What is EkScript? 

**EkScript compiles to many different languages with an easy to use but powerful compiler helping you write code that won't lose your trust in real battlegrounds \(i.e. production\)**

EkScript is easy-to-learn as it is almost 99% TypeScript syntax but more easier to use! It will save you from the perils of runtime-errors as well as compile-time errors. EkScript uses the JavaScript standard library. Being one of the most popular language, EkScript is the best choice for your next big project!

### Why EkScript?

EkScript was built out of the need for a programming language that meets the following requirements for an alternative language that...

1. **...is based on another very, very popular language users use at present:** Two choices emerge here: JavaScript and Python.
2. **...has static typing for avoiding runtime errors:** JavaScript has TypeScript. Python has mypy. TypeScript's popularity in this case again makes it the better choice to base EkScript on.
3. **...has a AOT and JIT mode without any VM:** JIT mode let's developers iterate on their programs fast. AOT mode let's users run the production based app fast natively. A compiler/language that supports both is not present at the moment \(Dart AOT still runs on DartV\).
4. **...least amount of Runtime errors and more compile time errors:** Runtime errors are a mess. TypeScript having loosely typed still runs on top of JavaScript with many caveats for runtime errors. Go still delegates many stuff to runtime. The compiler should be responsible for handling runtime errors.
5. **...has no Pointers.** Go is the closest to the requirement \(3\) \(it's compile time speed is fast\). But pointers are a mess to deal with. Rust is very good with that. Kotlin does a pretty good job with this. EkScript derives a lot from Kotlin thus.
6. **...has the standard libraries similar to JavaScript:** JavaScript's choice for the base language means that EkScript supports all NodeJS and Browser APIs out-of-the-box
7. **...compiles to many different Object-Oriented languages**: EkScript's ability to compile/transpile to JavaScript, C++, Dart, Kotlin and Swift gives is the ability to run everywhere and let's developers really **learn-once-write-once-run-anywhere.**

And many more things. Give it a go. You will love it.

### The EkScript Compiler

Written in Rust, The EkScript compiler is fast! Damn Fast! No more slow compile times you face with TypeScript.

**EkScript** ❤️ **TypeScript**

All TypeScript modules are 100% compatible with EkScript through an easy-to-use interop. So, no more wasting time relearning new languages.

**EkScript Bundler**

EkScript comes with a modern bundler that takes care of all the difficult configurations for you.
