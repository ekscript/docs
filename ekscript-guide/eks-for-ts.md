# Ekscript for TS Devs

EkScript is very, very similar to TypeScript. It has the same NodeJS APIs for server-side programming.

## Language specification

### 

## New Types

A few number types have been introduced in EkScript.

#### int, float

Character type: **char**

### No \`any\`, \`undefined\`, \`unknown\`, \`never\`, \`NaN\` and false-y values

To maintain a consistent strict code style, EkScript bars you from using `any` , `undefined` , `unknown` , `NaN` and `never` **.**`null` is to be used everywhere wherever previously you used `undefined`. This brings us to the concept of `nullable` and `non-nullable` types. Types that might have a `null` value or might not.

There are only two false-y values. That means `if` statements only take boolean and numbers for processing \(ruby like\). This also means that `!` unary operator is only for boolean types and number types. Yes, you have to write more code but this will save time in the long run!

```typescript
// --- ‚ùå ERROR! TS Only ‚ùå ---

let a = null;    // ‚ùåNo Type declaration here

let b: string  = 'Hello'  ; 
b = null; // ‚ùåNon-nullable type

let c = { hello: 'world' }; 
c.hello = null;

let d: undefined;    // ERROR! No type named as undefined

if (a) {}   // ‚ùå a is not boolean
if (!!c.hello) {} // ‚ùå a is not boolean

// --- ‚úÖ VALID! Eks ‚úÖ ---
let d: string? = 'Hello';
d = null;    // nullable type

if (d == null) {}

let a = 0;
if (a == 0) {}

type TC = { hello: string?, key: i32 }; // [key: string] : i32
let c = { hello: 'world' };
c.hello = null;    // nullable fields

function fn(a: object) {
    console.log(a?.hello);    // null
```

## Extra Additions + Improvements

### No more \`===\`!

Yes. No more '==' and '===' confusion. Simply write '==' everywhere.

### No Prototype, different \`this\`!

No more 2 ways of defining classes. EkScript is a modern language. It only supports ECMAScript classes. Everything about classes is similar to TypeScript!

This also means that `this` is no longer relevant in functions! Only in classes, `this` is supported. Finally!

```typescript
// --- ‚ùå ERROR! ‚ùå ---
Number.prototype.toExponential.call(1);
function f() {
    this.hello = 1;
    this.world = 2
}
f.prototype.hello = 3;
this.hello = 'there';
```

### Pattern Matching

There are two additions to EkScript. First is its pattern matcher which takes types as first class citizens:  


```typescript
const variable: string | int = 1;

match(variable)(
    int => console.log("int found"),
    string => console.log("")
)
```

### Improved `typeof` operator

Since we have types as first class citizens, EkScript provides a way to check types using simple \`typeof\` operator.

NOTE: This can only be used with certain binary operators and should be explicitly declared. \(More on that later\)

```typescript
// --- ‚úÖ VALID! ‚úÖ ---
if (typeof a == int) {
    console.log("int found");
} else if (typeof b == string) {
    console.log("string found")
}

// --- ERROR! ‚ùå ---
typeof typeof int; // cannot use it outside a binary expression
```

## Browser DOM APIs

 EkScript comes with `libDOM.d.ek` which is similar to `libDOM.d.ts` with a more strict API. TypeScript programmers won't even have to sweat on EkScript.

### JSON + EKON

In TypeScript, `JSON.parse` returns `any` type. EkScript doesn't have `any`. Instead it takes a generic type that will be inferred at runtime giving you type-safety. EkScript ships with [**EKON**](https://github.com/ekon-org/ekon) ****instead of JSON. **EKON** is a superset of JSON and is quite excellent as a message passing or configuration file.

```typescript
type THello = { hello: string } 

// --- ‚úÖ VALID! ‚úÖ ---
const var1 = EKON.parse<THello>('{ "hello": "world" }');
const var2: EKONObject = JSON.parse('{ "hello": "world" }');
const var3 = JSON.parse('{ "hello": "world" }'); // inferred as EKONObject

// --- ERROR! ‚ùå ---
const var3 = JSON.parse('{ "hello": "world" }');
someRandomFunc(JSON.parse('{ "hello": "world" }'));
```
